2) Zonal statistics (zonalStats.R)
3) Random Forest and feature importance analysis (randomForest.R)
4) Figures 4-8 and S6-10 (illustrations.R)
5) Analysis of coefficient of variance and correlation of variables, as well as Figures S1-S5 in the Supplements (supplements.R)

All data produced in the analysis as well as references to original data sources can be accessed through a Zenodo deposit: 10.5281/zenodo.5562038.
